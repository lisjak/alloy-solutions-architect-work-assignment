*An Alloy client has reported that their new build is failing when they attempt to deploy it. 
How would you go about diagnosing the issue and getting them back on the road to success?*

---

The first thing I would do if a client reported a new build failing upon deployment would be to thank the client for his or her patience and continued use of Alloy's product despite the hiccup. I would also apologize for any inconvenience currently being experienced by the user due to deployment failure. 

Immediately following niceties, I would begin troubleshooting. I would request the build log for a reference message that could help in rectifying the problem, and I would inquire as to whether the build is capable of running locally. I would check to make sure that there are no dependency related errors occurring, and I would also check to see that all tests (unit, integration, functional and performance) are passing. I would also check to see that the code is compiling in addition to checking that all syntax and style guides have been followed as well. If I would not be able to discover the reason for build failure with a cursory investigation, I would utilize a debugger while sleuthing out the cause manually. I would investigate any error messages that I encounter along the way by referencing crowd-sourced materials in order to diagnose the root problem. 

Upon discovery of the issue, I would assist the client in rectifying the error and would provide information on how to avoid further potential build failures in the future.
